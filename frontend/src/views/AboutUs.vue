        <p class="info-text">Observational Film Club started in March 2024. 
         Tired of burning candle at both ends we decided to create 
         a community that would host and unite TAU and TAMK ecosystems better. 
         The most accessible medium turned out to be watching cinema — 
         it provides immediate and concurrent experience to the viewers. 
         It also invites for a discussion afterwards, that allows 
         to see a film from multiple points of view. As time passes, 
         it has developed into what it is now.</p>
